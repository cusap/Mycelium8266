# Mycelium8266

Mycelium is a versatile open-source library for creating automated IoT hydroponic systems, smart gardens, environmental monitoring systems, and more!

Check out [our wiki](https://github.com/cusap/Mycelium8266/wiki) to get started.

## Version
Mycelium8266 is designed for the ESP8266 microcontroller. 

There is an archived version available for the Particle microcontollers [here](https://github.com/cusap/mycelium-library). This version is no longer updated due to the discontinuation of the Particle Mesh microcontollers.

**Coming Soon: Mycelium32 (ESP32 Support), MyceliumPy (Python Support)**
